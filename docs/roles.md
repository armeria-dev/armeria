# Contributor Roles

If you want to work on Armeria, you will fall into one of two roles. These roles
are either **Core Contributor** or **External Contributor**. These cover _any_
type of contribution and are not just limited to code-based contributions.

## External Contributor

An external contributor is anyone who's even remotely interested in working on
Armeria. They can contribute to just about anything: code, documentation, story,
etc. When working on code, they will maintain a forked version of Armeria and
create pull requests as they work on features. They will _not_ have a privileged
character (and therefore not have the ability to work on in-game content) within
the production version of Armeria.

## Core Contributor

A core contributor is someone who is deeply invested in the development of
Armeria. This person will need to help maintain the code base, be involved with
game decisions, feature planning, and testing. They may also be given a
privileged character on the production version of Armeria to help with in-game
content (ie: building areas) and help maintain the community as a whole.

### How do I become a core contributor?

First and foremost, this game is open-source and can be ran locally with an
abundance of example data. Anyone can contribute to the game, so long as you
adhere to the [Contribution](docs/contributing.md) rules and [Code of
Conduct](docs/code-of-conduct.md). If you would like to have a deeper
investiment in the development of Armeria and/or would like to help with
building in-game content, you can join our community Discord and let us know!
